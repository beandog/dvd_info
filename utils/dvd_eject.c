	 * Opens / closes a disc tray, and decrypts the CSS on the drive to avoid
	 * any spatial anomalies (and hardware devices whining to the kernel about
	 * reading sectors without authentication). Requires libdvdcss as a
	 * dependency library.
	 *
	 * Three return values: 0 on success, 1 on error, 2 on success and drive has
	 * a DVD inside of it.
	 *
	 * To build:
	 * $ gcc -o dvd_eject dvd_eject.c -l dvdcss
	 *
	 * Usage:
	 * $ dvd_eject -h
	 *
	 * BUGS
	 *
	 * I found one race condition where if you close the tray (using dvd_eject -t),
	 * have a trigger mount it when udev fires one, and immediately try to eject
	 * it again, it will fail. Unlocking the tray seems to be a requirement before
	 * it can send a command to open it. So, if you have a sequence like this, it
	 * will try, but fail: 1) close tray 2) mount disc 3) immediately eject. I
	 * believe the reason is that the drive status will report whether its ready or
	 * not, regardless of it being in the process of mounted. The is_mounted check
	 * will pass, and unmounting it passes fine as well, but unlocking the door
	 * will continue to fail. I haven't been able to find a fix for this yet.
	 * However, you shouldn't run into this bug unless you are debugging like me.
	 *
	 * Story mode:
	 *
	 * I've spent a lot of time trying to track down why the hardware will send
	 * errors to the systemlog like so:
	 *
	 * "Sense Key : Illegal Request [current]"
	 * "Add. Sense: Read of scrambled sector without authentication"
	 *
	 * I'm debugging them not because I care about the messages, but becaue if it
	 * happens enough, the drives will eventually lock up and be unable to process
	 * any more discs (until next reboot).
	 *
	 * I've narrowed down two things that help a lot to prevent them as best as I
	 * can:
	 *
	 * 1. Make as *few* calls as possible to the device to check on its status
	 *    (this program does that -- it keeps it to a bare minimum)
	 * 2. Use libdvdcss to authenticate access to the DVD.
	 *
	 * Those two combined seem to help in large amounts, but I've never found
	 * anything that is a sure fire solution.
	 *
	 * The basic logic of this program and reason for it is this: Opening and
	 * closing a disc tray is trivial. The issue this one works around, however,
	 * is that just because a tray is *closed*, does not mean that it is *ready* to
	 * acess the media in it. This can cause issues when you do something like
	 * "lsdvd /dev/dvd" and the tray is open. The tray will close by the call made
	 * through libdvdread / libdvdcss to access the device, but will fail because
	 * the device is not yet in a ready mode. So there's a gap between "closing" and
	 * "closed and ready". Fortunately, the Linux kernel allows for checking those
	 * states, and that's the core of the logic here.
	 *
	 * With that in mind, all this does is close or open the tray, wait until it is
	 * a "ready" state again, and then exits. In addition, if it closes the tray,
	 * it waits until the "ready" state and then decrypts the CSS using libdvdcss.
	 *
	 * If anecdotal evidence has any value ... it works for me. :)
	 *
	 * Good luck, and here's to all the other DVD collectors / multimedia geeks out
	 * there! :D
	 *
