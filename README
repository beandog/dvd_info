Documentation:

  * See man pages for each program
  * https://github.com/beandog/dvd_info/wiki

The git repo on github is intended to build from a straight pull. Documentation
for building from source for Ubuntu is on the github wiki above.

Caching:

If you're going to do a lot of reads on a disc drive, I'd recommend mounting it
so the access can be cached -- this is especially helpful when using / testing
dvd_copy a lot to get chapters, titles, etc.

  # mount /dev/sr0 -o ro -t udf /mnt/dvd

Compatability:

I try porting my code to other systems, and in addition to popular Linux
distros, it runs fine on BSD systems as well.

Support:

I love hunting down anomalies, so if you run into something odd on a disc, let
me know and I'd love to look into it. Bug reports are good, too.
