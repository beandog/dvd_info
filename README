The git repo on github is intended to build from a straight pull. There
are programs I'm working on that are not in the Makefile.am yet (or there are
more than are in the repo). You can, of course, try to build it, but I don't
target releases here.

If you're going to do a lot of reads on a disc drive, I'd recommend mounting it
so the access can be cached -- this is especially helpful when using / testing
dvd_copy a lot to get chapters, titles, etc.

  # mount /dev/sr0 -o ro -t udf /mnt/dvd

Depending on your luck / region / disc drive / disc / local alien invasion, you
may or may not be able to make an ISO directly from a disc.

If you want to give it a whirl, I recommend ddrescue:

  $ ddrescue -b 2048 -n /dev/sr0 dvd.iso ddrescue.log

I try porting my code to other systems, and in addition to popular Linux
distros, it runs fine on BSD systems as well.

Support:

I love hunting down anomalies, so if you run into something odd on a disc, let
me know and I'd love to look into it. Bug reports are good, too.
