dvd_info - a set of utilities for accessing DVDs

Includes:

* dvd_info - display information about a DVD in human-readable or JSON output,
	disc title, disc ID, disc chapters in OGM container format

* dvd_copy - copy a DVD title to the filesystem

* dvd_drive_status - display drive status: open, closed, closed with disc,
	or polling

Requirements:

* libdvdread >= 4.2.1 (libdvdcss required for decryption)

The git repo on github is intended to build from a straight pull. There
are programs I'm working on that are not in the Makefile.am yet (or there are
more than are in the repo). You can, of course, try to build it, but I don't
target releases here.

If you're going to do a lot of reads on a disc drive, I'd recommend mounting it
so the access can be cached -- this is especially helpful when using / testing
bluray_copy a lot to get chapters, titles, playlists, etc.

  # mount /dev/sr0 -o ro -t udf /mnt/dvd

Depending on your luck / region / disc drive / disc / local alien invasion, you
may or may not be able to make an ISO directly from a disc.

If you want to give it a whirl, I recommend ddrescue:

  $ ddrescue -b 2048 -n /dev/sr0 dvd.iso ddrescue.log

I try porting my code to other systems, and in addition to popular Linux
distros, it runs fine on BSD systems as well.

I take a minimalist approach to my code, and so there is only the minimum
of required autotools content in the repo: configure.ac and Makefile.am
This allows the user to build the config files on their system. Run
"autoreconf -fi" and you'll have the familiar configure, make, make install
setup.

Other stuff:

I don't have my own tool to copy the entire DVD file structure to the
filesystem, simply because I don't really need one. I use dvdbackup, and that's
what I'd recommend. See http://dvdbackup.sourceforge.net/

Support:

I love hunting down anomalies, so if you run into something odd on a disc, let
me know and I'd love to look into it. Bug reports are good, too.

If you want to say thanks, buy me a Blu-ray disc :D There's nothing I'd love
more than a new disc to play with (and something to watch as well).
Here's my Amazon wishlist: http://a.co/ik9j9Fw if you're feeling generous!
