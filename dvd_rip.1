.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
A tiny DVD ripper that has a small set of options for encoding.
.sp
By default, dvd_rip will encode source to H.264 video with AAC audio in an
MP4 container. If an output filename is given with a different extension,
it will use the default settings for those instead. In each case, the default
presets are used as selected by the codecs as well. Note that mpv must already
be built with support for these codecs, or dvd_rip will quit.
