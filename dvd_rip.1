.SH "NAME"
dvd_rip \- a tiny DVD ripper using libmpv as backend
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBdvd_rip\fP [\fIPATH\fP] [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
A tiny DVD ripper that has a small set of options for encoding.
.sp
Options and switches can be set in ~/.config/dvd_rip/mpv.conf. See the mpv
documentation for details.
.sp
By default, dvd_rip will encode source to H.264 video with Opus audio in an
MKV container. If an output filename is given with a different extension,
it will use the default settings for those instead. In each case, the default
presets are used as selected by the codecs as well. Note that mpv must already
be built with support for these codecs, or dvd_rip will quit.

With no options, the largest track will be ripped with the first audio track,
to a file named dvd_track_#.mkv, where # is a zero\-padded name of the track
number.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-o, \-\-output\fP=\fIFILENAME\fP
.RS 4

.SH "BUGS"
.sp
\fBdvd_rip\fP uses libmpv, but does not always act exactly how mpv would for
some reason. Because of that, there are some issues still.
.sp
\fBdvd_rip\fP sometimes breaks on tracks that libdvdnav moves around on, and so
it can be unpredictable, or encode past a track\(cqs actual length.
.sp
\fBdvd_rip\fP does not wait for an optical device to be ready. Wait for it to
finish "polling" before running the program.
