NAME
----
dvd_rip - a tiny DVD ripper using ffmpeg

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dvd_rip* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A tiny DVD ripper that has a small set of options for encoding.

By default, dvd_rip will encode source to H.264 video with AAC audio in an
MP4 container. If an output filename is given with a different extension,
it will use the default settings for those instead. In each case, the default
presets are used as selected by the codecs as well. Note that mpv must already
be built with support for these codecs, or dvd_rip will quit.

	.mp4 - H.264 video, AAC audio
	.mkv - H.264 video, AAC audio
	.webm - VP8 video, Opus audio

With no options, the largest track will be ripped with all audio and subtitle
tracks to a file named dvd_rip.mp4.
