NAME
----
dvd_rip - a tiny DVD ripper using libmpv as backend

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dvd_rip* ['PATH'] ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A tiny DVD ripper that has a small set of options for encoding.

Options and switches can be set in ~/.config/dvd_rip/mpv.conf. See the mpv
documentation for details.

By default, dvd_rip will encode source to H.264 video with AAC audio in an
MPEG-4 container. If an output filename is given with a different extension,
it will use the default settings for those instead. In each case, the default
presets are used as selected by the codecs as well. Note that mpv must already
be built with support for these codecs, or dvd_rip will quit.

	.mp4 - H.264 video, AAC audio
	.mkv - HEVC video, AAC audio
	.webm - VPX9 video, Opus audio

With no options, the largest track will be ripped with the first audio track,
to a file named dvd_track_#.mp4, where # is a zero-padded name of the track
number.

OPTIONS
-------

*-o, --output*='FILENAME':: Save to filename (default: 'dvd_track_\#.mp4'),
	where default track is longest one on DVD, and ## is zero-padded
	track number.

*-t, --track*='TRACK'::
	Encode track number. Default is longest valid track.

*-c, --chapter*='CHAPTER[-[CHAPTER]]'
	Encode chapter number or range. Default is all chapters.

*-a, --alang*='LANGUAGE'
	Select audio track by language code, two letters. Default is first
	audio track.

*-A, --aid*='#'
	Select audio track by stream ID.

*-s, --slang*='LANGUAGE'
	Select subtitle track by language code, two letters. Default is no
	subtitles.

*-v, --vcodec*='x264|x265|vpx'
	Video codec to use. H.264 (x264) has widest support, including
	HTML5. H.265 (x265) videos will be smaller than H.264. VPX 9 can also
	be played back with HTML5.

*-q, --crf*='#'
	Video encoder CRF to use. The default is the baseline for the codec.

*-a, --acodec*='aac|opus'
	Audio codec to use. AAC is lossy while Opus is lossless. Both options
	will downmix to 2 channels (stereo).

*-h, --help*
	Display help output.

BUGS
----
*dvd_rip* does not wait for an optical device to be ready. Wait for it to
finish "polling" before running the program.

When ripping a specific set of chapters, libmpv will display in the progress
bar the length of the entire video.
