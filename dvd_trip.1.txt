NAME
----
dvd_trip - a tiny DVD ripper using libmpv as backend

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dvd_trip* ['PATH'] ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A tiny DVD ripper that has a small set of options for encoding.

Options and switches can be set in ~/.config/dvd_trip/mpv.conf. See the mpv
documentation for details.

By default, dvd_trip will encode source to H.264 video with AAC audio in an
MP4 container. If an output filename is given with a different extension,
it will use the default settings for those instead. In each case, the default
presets are used as selected by the codecs as well. Note that mpv must already
be built with support for these codecs, or dvd_trip will quit.

	.mp4 - H.264 video, AAC audio
	.mkv - H.264 video, AAC audio

With no options, the largest track will be ripped with the first audio track,
to a file named dvd_track_#.mp4, where # is a zero-padded name of the track
number.

OPTIONS
-------

*-o, --output*='FILENAME':: Save to filename (default: 'dvd_track_\#.mp4'),
	where default track is longest one on DVD, and ## is zero-padded
	track number.

	Encode track number. Default is longest valid track.

*-c, --chapter*='CHAPTER[-[CHAPTER]]'
	Encode chapter number or range. Default is all chapters.

*--start*='[\+|-][[hh:]mm:]ss[.ms]'

*--stop*='[\+|-][[hh:]mm:]ss[.ms]'
        Stop at time length in format in [+|-][[hh:]mm:]ss[.ms] or <percent>%

BUGS
----
*dvd_trip* sometimes breaks on tracks that libdvdnav moves around on, and so
it can be unpredictable, or encode past a track's actual length.

*dvd_trip* does not wait for an optical device to be ready. Wait for it to
finish "polling" before running the program.
