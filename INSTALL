Installation instructions for specific distros are at https://github.com/beandog/dvd_info/wiki

Assuming you have 'libdvdread' and libdvdcss installed, it should build and run just fine:

$ ./configure && make && sudo make install

If you want 'dvd_rip' and 'dvd_player', you'll need libmpv (part of 'mpv' package) installed as well:

$ ./configure --with-libmpv && make && sudo make install

If you are having problems with the configure script or makefiles, you can rebuild them. You will need 'autoconf' and 'automake' installed first:

$ autoreconf -fi
$ ./configure && make && sudo make install
