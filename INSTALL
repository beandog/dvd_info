Installation instructions for specific distros are at https://github.com/beandog/dvd_info/wiki

You will need cmake installed to build the programs:

$ cmake .

After that, build and install:

$ make
$ sudo make install

To remove:

$ sudo make uninstall

The Makefile will automatically check to see if you have libmpv installed, and then build and install dvd_player and dvd_trip.

If don't have cmake or want to use it, you can use the old autotools scripts, but will need automake and autoconf installed.

$ autoreconf -fi
$ ./configure

For dvd_player and dvd_trip, you will have to run --with-libmpv
$ ./configure --with-libmpv

$ make
$ sudo make install
