.SH NAME
dvd_drive_status \- display the status of a DVD optical tray
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdvd_drive_status\fR [device]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdvd_drive_status\fR returns the state of an optical drive.

Optical drives can have one of six states: open, opening, closed, closing, closed with or without a disc.

When an optical drive is physically opening or closing, there is a "polling" state where it cannot be accessed.  dvd_drive_status prints out the optical drive's state and returns a relevant exit code as well.

Exit codes:

 \fB1\fR - no disc (closed, no media)
 \fB2\fR - tray open
 \fB3\fR - drive not ready (opening or polling)
 \fB4\fR - drive ready (closed, has media)
 \fB5\fR - device exists, but is NOT a DVD drive
 \fB6\fR - cannot access device
 \fB7\fR - cannot find a device

Use \fBdvd_eject(1)\fR to both close a tray and wait for it to finish polling.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBdvd_drive_status\fR will take the device path as an argument, or use the system's default optical drive if none is given.
