NAME
----
dvd_info - displays information about a DVD

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dvd_info* ['DVD PATH'] ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Displays information about a DVD optical disc, image, or directory in
human-readable, JSON, or formatted chapter outputs.

The default device is based on your operating system, and is the primary
optical drive.

DVDs can store two kinds of subtitles -- VOBSUB, which are images, and closed
captioning, which are text. Only the VOBSUB subtitles are reported here.

DVDs may be authored by the provider to intentionally have bugs on the
structure that will cause problems during playback or ripping if the correct
track is not selected. *dvd_info* does its best to work around and flag these
tracks as invalid. See the JSON or verbose output formats to see which ones
are tagged.

DVDs may also have audio and subtitle streams marked as inactive as well. This
is normal, and usually won't show up at all in other DVD applications.

The ID of a DVD is a md5 hash of the IFOs on the disc.

The disc title is the volume name of the DVD's UDF. It will only appear if the
source is an ISO file or a physical disc.

DVDs support three audio codecs: ac3 (Dolby Digital), dts, and pcm. Dolby
Digital and DTS support up to 6 channels (5.1 surround sound). PCM supports
stereo only.

DVDs support multiple audio and subtitle languages. These are displayed in
output as a two letter string. Examples: de - German, en - English, fr -
French, it - Italian, etc.
