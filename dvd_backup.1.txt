DVD_BACKUP(1)
=============
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
dvd_backup - backup an entire DVD or a Video Title Set

SYNOPSIS
--------
*dvd_backup* ['PATH'] ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The dvd_backup(1) program will copy either an entire DVD's contents or a video
title set to the filesystem. The output directory will be the UDF volume name
of the disc, the name passed for the directory, or DVD_VIDEO if no label
exists.

dvd_backup will read each block individually, and write it to the output
file(s). If a block cannot be read, it will fill it with null data, which
should preserve playback. If a disc is damaged, reading can take a long time
for each broken block. The amount of skipped blocks is displayed on output.

The default device is based on your operating system, and is the primary
optical drive.

For backing up a single track, see dvd_copy(1).

BUGS
----
*dvd_backup* does not wait for an optical device to be ready. Wait for it to
finish "polling" before running the program.
